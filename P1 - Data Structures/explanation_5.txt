The blockchain was implemented similar to a singly linked list. It takes O(1) time to append a new block and block deletion is not allowed. Using a linked list structure to implement the blockchain came naturally, since we wanted to build a chain where blocks are linked one after another and we wanted to be able to traverse from the genesis node to a given node to verify the chain integrity by validating the hash value in each block that has a domino effect on the whole chain.

The value that goes in the hash of a block is a concatenated string of the timestamp, the data and the hash value of the previous block. Since the hash value from the previous node is included in calculating a hash contaminating a node on a chain will cause hash validation down the chain to fail.
