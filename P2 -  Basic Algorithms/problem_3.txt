since the time complexity requirement was O(nlogn), we could use merge_sort to sort a given input_list first to reduce the problem to a simpler problem.

1. time complexity is O(nlogn) due to the fact that merge_sort is used.
2. space complexity is O(2n) from the size of input_list and output list
