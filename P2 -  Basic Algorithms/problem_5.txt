a map data structure is used in each node to store children nodes. since a map has an amortized time complexity of O(1) for insertion and lookup, 
it can keep the time complexity of the whole Trie in linear.

1. time complexity is O(n) for both insert() and find() where n is the size of word
2. space complexity is also O(n) where n is the size of word
