# Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree Program by Udacity
Course work for the Udacity course of Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Nanodegree Program

This course was made up of 4 parts and every part ended with a project at the end. Each project consisted of multiple problems ranging from small to medium sized that took me from a few minutes to a few hours to complete. Time/space complexity analysis and explantions were required as parts of the project assignments.

I completed the course during the COVID2019 quarantine period as a refresher course. You can find all the work that I did and also explanations that went with it in this repository.

I had a lot of fun from this course and completing all the projects in it, especially Huffman coding. It gave me new insights and I learned a lot from it.
